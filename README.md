# Robot_9152_Code_2024
Rat Fight 9152 robot code for 2024
Robot-2024-Code-WorkingMain


The code consists of Swerve drive, Shooter, Intake and Climber code.

We made the code by merging the Barlow Robotics swerve drive code with Cranberry Alarm's shooter and intake code. 
Barlow's code: https://github.com/Barlow-Robotics/Chompy-2024-Code 
Cranberry Alarm's Code: https://github.com/CranberryAlarm/CA24_RobotCode?tab=readme-ov-file#deploy. 


Our Team Code problems:
Wheels are turning on their own (due to not having the naviex)
Magnets are being diffcult (maybe due to having the wrong values)
Duplicate Robot code and Main code files (Due to the merging of 2 different sets of robot code)
